VRRPG 【Sword And Sorcery】

The popular full immersion RPG title released for the latest gaming platform【Dream Works】

The game itself is currently on the seventh upgrade and the number of enthusiastic users is still rising.

This device capable of synchronizing with brain sinapses giving a feeling of presence outdid what other game companies have ever done. A digital yet real world where you can experience all five senses, people became addicted one after another, in spite of being a little pricey it managed to grasp the heart of the players seeking for thrill.

<br>

Among these players Osako Satoshi, player name 【Zeros Merlin】, was enjoying this world.

<br>

His avatar had hair long enough to hide his eyes due to neglect and his face was unshaven, in other words, it had an hopeless appearance.

His equipment was of the highest grade, but he specially chose a plain and unified design so as not to stand out.  
Wearing a dirty gray robe, he was indeed a medium build sorcerer that many players wouldn't think that he is one of the top five players.

However, he was a top class annihilator in this world.

<br>

In this game one's battle prowess vary greatly depending on one's level and skills.

Other elements worth mentioning would be, of course, the creation of equipment and items, moreover the possibility of spell crafting.

In this digital world sorcery is based on 56 phonemes and 10 numeral characters, by piling and lining different codes varied magical effects can be brought forth

<br>

The technique named【Spell Circuit】allowed players to reconstruct the initial spell with their own hands, It is possible the change it's power and effect, however, the more refined and complex the reconstruction it ends up producing a weird condition where the maximum power output and consumption of magic power is reduced (Why does the magical power consumption also goes down?)

> I'm *still* confused but I'll leave it at that

No matter how one calculates the attack power should end up being 0, however, for some reason it was commom place for it to show an frightening power degree, therefore the players gathered together to investigate the reason behind it. This has brought chaos to the early stages of the the release, soon enough people were calling it a shit game.

By using the avatar's magical power as a trigger, it was confirmed the magic within a field is used by the spell. If the technique is practicable and meets the conditions, the spell is said to be completed.

<br>

In any case, as the magic power in the field does not show up as numbers, a lot of trial and error was used to measure the correct amount of magical power to be used as the trigger.

The uproar during the release occurred due to people restructuring spells haphazardly without any hints, it was the result of coincidence.

Such was the other face of the coin, players personally got hints from fields and dungeons in order to investigate, it was up to oneself to challenge or to ignore it.

As a game it presented an awesome degree of freedom, the players who got addicted to it are the ones who have a reasonable educational background, the great majority of the players used spells as it was without tweaking it.

Spell crafting demanded an scary amount of dedication, that being so it was considered more productive to enjoy adventures freely.

<br>

By restructuring spells it was possible to bring the recast time to zero as well as completly eliminating the casting time needed

Satoshi, who got hooked on the deepth of the system, was creating highly destructive, low energy cost spells one after another, he was well known in this world as a sorcerer.

An infamous sorcerer...

<br>

He formed a party with 4 of his friends that were on the same level as him, they completed several quests of high difficulty and continued to do so.

Currently the 5 of them were fighting an evil god on the story mode.

<br>

They didn't know for how long they've been fighting.

The only thing that could be said is that they've come here to completly obliterate the last boss.

The evil god now unveiled its third and sinister form, the 5 of them exposed its atrocious form with their own hands.

Despite of being sorcerers, they were equipped with a variety of weapons on their hands. From the beginning to the end they continued to overwhelm the evil god with brutal fire power and violence.

<br>

It has been seven years since the game release, this party usually monopolized the top ranked players podium.

The main reason behind it was their restructured spells, its power and effect was classified as the strongest. To Satoshi who liked to live willfully, this world was the unique place where he felt at ease.

<br>

Once he had his name on a top grade corporation as a software engeneer, but for some reason it was forcibly restructured, currently he is living isolated on the countryside.

Everyday after working on the fields he would immerse himself on the game, in other words he was a [hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori).

In this virtual world he is a 【Sage】, being a strong individual there was a fact that connected himself further to this world.

Despite being over 40 years old he is single, the only person he could call his family was his older sister, this fictional world was the place where he could expose himself.

By the way, in the real world he was a so called wizard. `I.E. 30+ yo virgin`

His personal appearance was not bad, he could be popular if he cared for his appearance, but he didn't.

<br>

『Now then... isn't it about time to close things up?』

『Ou! quickly kill him』

『I'll give support from here. Be grateful ok?』

『I'm  wonder what kind of rare items we will get』

『Well then, shall we go with a formation for the finisher?』

<br>

Attacking on waves, their overwhelming sorcery enclosed the evil god reducing its **HP** to 0 in a blink.

<br>

Because they are too strong, there are a lot of suspicions of them cheating on the web.

However, the thing called overzealousness can sometimes overthrow commom sense, they paid no attention to others and continued to develop several spells.

These spells were overly complicated, other players looking for a walkthrough were giving their opinions on the pros and cons of this mysterious system.

For an outsider it was considerably dishonest situation, the feeling of overdoing it was excessive, for their spells were ridiculously powerful.

Above all, they wouldn't hand over the magic they've made to others, people's suspicion of cheat was getting bigger because of this fact.

<br>

『And it's over』

『What will you do now? Commemoration party? I'm going to sleep...』

『I'll pass, I have to work after this. I'm going to log out now』

『Me as well. Sorry, I'll make up for it on the next opportunity』

『Then, we'll finish it by here today. Everyone, good rest～♪』

『『『『Good rest～♪』』』』

<br>

His companions begin to log out one after another

<br>

Satoshi remained alone in the evil god's castle checking the loot

However, the fact that he was there was the reason why everything happened.

<br>

All of a sudden the body of the evil god moves

While reasing omnious miasma, it was glaring at the enemy in front of whim with hatred filled eyes

<br>

『Unforgivable... The existence of the ones like you who destroyed me... I'LL DEFINETLY NOT FORGIVE IT!!』

『Wha-?! Impossible, its **HP** should be 0...』

『Cursed, annoying goddesses... those who sealed me, but also these ignorant fools who opposited me!!』

『The event has not ended yet?! It can't-』

<br>

The evil god released a cursed power by clashing together his wrath and all his anger.

The surroundings were wrapped up by light.

<br>

This day, all the power supplies on Japan halted.

Along with that, several people were found dead and the cause of their death remain unknown.

<br>

Osako Satoshi silently took his last breath on the remote countryside this day.

# Ossan Reincarnates in Another World

When he realized, he was within a dense forest.

Satoru looked around, but he had no idea how he ended up at a place like this.

He paid close attention to his surroundings. No matter where he looked at only trees could be seen, among these were some vegetation he had never seen before.

<br>

「What is this place? If I'm not mistaken, I was playing at my roo-...」

<br>

　―――Gegya、Gegyaa！ 

<br>

「・・・・・・・・・・」

<br>

A bird was crying as it flew through the skies, the psychedelic chirping let Satoru at a loss for words.

He sunk into further confusion by this creature, it clearly wasn't from Earth.

Rather, It was more probable that this isn't Earth.

At any rate, none of the building present on Earth could be seen, he was enclosed by a thic jungle. It isn't strange that he was speechless after seeing two moons on the sky.

<br>

「Trully, what place is this? at least it doesn't seem to be japan... There are some really strange plants here. Or rather, not one plant that I've ever seen before...」

<br>

A plant that seemed like a mix from a [rafflesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia) and a [pitcher plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher_plant) captured a wolf like beast with its ivy in the front of his eyes, and carried it to the center of its giant flower. He heard then a crunch like sound coming from it.

At least it did not exist on eath, even if it existed, it wouldn't be a plant bigger than two meters.

To say nothing of the fangs growing from the center of the flower, such a thing is biologically impossible.

<br>

At this time, he felt a little disconfort on his waist and changed his attention to it.

Looking at it Satoru was, once again, at a loss for words.

There were few things on his waist, but there were two things clearly made to combat there. A thing he himself knew very well from the game was reflected at his eyes.

It was a sword.

<br>

It was called 【Short Sword】, a sword light enough to use one handed.

This was a sharp sword was forged by crafter type players in the game, plentiful of rare ingredients where used on these two pieces of equipment hanging from his waist. 

<br>

This was the world inside the game, yet the little remaining common sense he still had denyed it.

While thinking that such a thing was just impossible, he noticed a certain thing.

What he is wearing right now is a dirty gray robe, the same that his avatar was equipped with.

<br>

「ha, HAHAHA... Such a thing, such a thing can't be, right? Transfered to the game world? This isn't a common plot setting for a novel or anything...」

<br>

He could but laugh.

No matter how much he wanted to deny, the answer was already in front of his eyes.

<br>

「Open・・・・Status・・・・Just kiddi--」

<br>

Wanting it just to be a joke, these words were said unconsciously.

Nevertheless, the same status screen of the game was floating in front of his eyes.

For a brief moment his conscience flew somewhere.

<br>

「This can't be..., this is a joke, isn't it? Is someone trolling me... Something of this level is just impossible. What did happen with my body?」

「This, it's not on a human level anymore. It's a freaking super human in many ways. Seriously...」

<br>

Obviously it's not human.

Even without knowing the standards of this world, no matter how you think this is utterlly strange.

Truth be told, in the game he was already peerless, in what concerns spells he was on the same level as the evil god.

Considering about the 5 of them, they have long past the domain of a human.

<br>

While fiddling with the status screen, Satoru wore a dead face while he continued to look at it.

<br>

「Huh?, this is... a mail? Hm, the sender is... Unknown...」

<br>

Right down on the status screen command display, red characters were blinking, indicating that a mail has come.

Trembling slightly he opened the mail...

<br>

「...hmmm・・・・・・・・Huh? **GOD**?!」

<br>

The subject was 『About what is happening right now to you♡』.

It only gave him a bad feeling.

The heart is annoying, right when he had a hunch that he could not trust this world's god.

<br>

『Yahoo～♡　Nice to meet you, I'm the goddess Freyless-chan, Hold your head high～♡』

> **TN**: her name in japanese is `フレイレス` read as `fureiresu`.

<br>

「It is ok to erase it, isn't it? I'm feeling that something started to smell really bad on the air...」

<br>

He felt somewhat―― no, he felt really annoyed.

He felt it really hard to cope with this tension while his head is a mess.

<br>

『There's no time, I'll say it real quick ok? Approximately 2487 have passed since I've sealed the evil god with the hero buut～, it seems that this place was inside the game you played on your world～

At that world, a lo～t of people were sacrificed in order to seal him once again but, I couldn't completly defeat him so I had to seal him in another world oke～y. *AHAHAHA*♡』

<br>

「Annoying・・・・・・I mean, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!」

<br>

『Don't thow non-inflammables randomly in other people's world, was it? Exa～ctly, at that time I had no other way to do it oka～y

And then, and then. I thought that you people could seal him from inside the game, and just as I thought. Thank you for magnificently sealing him.

He was a really annoying fellow you know～. I can't even believe that she was a goddess being that unsightly!』

<br>

「・・・・・That was a goddess? I couldn't think of it but a heap of visceras」

<br>

*What I remember is a lump of disgusting parts of several creatures, a grotesque *UMA*.*

*A pile of internal organs would be 100 times less disgusting than that, a somewhat hard to understand life form.*

*I'm feeling sick just by remembering it, it's really hard to believe that it was a goddess.*

<br>

『But I wouldn't ever think that she would blow up herself while involving you all. Being honest, I was sweating～?

and the～n, I decided on reincarnating the ones who lost their lives on this incide～nt. But their game data has been reset, right♡?』

<br>

「It cant't be... Was I among these?」

<br>

『As you sealed the evil god, you are special～, I got you reincarnated with your game data as it were okay?

As this world isn't that different from the game, you will have a truly easy reincarnation. You can be as peerless as you want, You've done it♡』

<br>

「I want to hit her... I want to hit the ones like her that made us clean up after her mess until she cries...」

<br>

It would not be surprising if a common folk thought the same if their very life was snatched away by an one-sided plot.

Even him had drawn some plans for the future.

But that was brushed off by a halfhearted reason, and they've even been made accomplices while not looking.

It is not something someone can lightly accept.

<br>

『From the materials to the equipments on your possession, I've reconstructed all of them with this world's equivalent. Give it your best♡

but, make your own cosumable items, ok? The way of doing it should've been installed on your brains already, take your time confirming that okay～♡

Your age should be the same as your previous world, if I'd rejuvenated you I would have to make your items again myself? Sorry, sorry～

You see～, complains from the gods that govern your world were coming, and coming... I had no other choice but to reincarnate you all～?

...Revivind the dead is clearly against the divine providence oka～y

That being the case, enjoy the rest of your lives on this world, okay?♡ Now then, see ya～ Bye By～e♡』

<br>

*I understood the reason, but the situation did not improve.*

*Even now, I don't even know where I am. I'm just standing inside this forest.*

*Above all else, I can't feel anything but anger about this goddess attitude.*

<br>

「Every one of there `♡` marks are annoying. ...For the time being I understood my present situation, the problem now is whether there are people living by the vicinity...」

<br>

It's dangerous to wander aimlessly when one does not know where they are.

This world resembles the game, then it's very likely that there are monsters roaming around.

While considering what to do, for the time being I've decided to survey this place from a higher location.

<br>

「It would be nice if I can use it... 『Wings of the Dark Crow』」

<br>

Wings of the Dark Crow is a flying spell Satoru came up while in the game.

This magic has taken into account the bad performance of the initial spell, by employing a massive technique it was possible to bring down the magical power consumption endlessly, truly a masterpiece.

In the settings of the game world, residents of the world are supposed to have a database built with magical power in the brain.

By improving the base spell and then storing it in the brain, it was possible to use sort of spells.

<br>

Furthermore, it is possible to tweak further the magic that one stored, for this purpose is necessary a special magical formation.

As a result, Satoru would come up with new spells as soon as a new idea hit him.

This spell has been updated on this world.

Being release from the chains of gravity, Satotu begins to ascend to the skies.

<br>

「wo-WOo!? Splendid, I flew! I actually just flew!!」

<br>

For a moment the 40 years old ossan got as excited as a child would, but soon he remembered his goal and looked around from the skies.

However...

<br>

「Forest as far as I can see huh... I wonder where is the city.」

<br>

The forest spread vastly on scenery, even though he's spotted some mountains, civilization was nowhere to be seen.

He searched for a village or a city, but he wasn't able to find a single one.

<br>

「No matter how I think about it, isn't this a punishment game?」

<br>

He flew to whatever direction he felt like while grumbling.

Just like some incompetent migratory bird...

<br>

　　◇　　◇　　◇　　◇

<br>

As soon he felt that the spell was running out, he would quietly descend to the ground and recast it. He had done it for a few hours now.

and of course no village or city could be seen.

That being the state of things, he should now think about preparing for camping.

As long as one is not dead eating is a must, if not they'd starve to death.

<br>

「Even if I say it... right?」

<br>

Even though the mail said that all of his materials have been refounded, he could not see even a speck of food on his inventory.

While in the game he had properly collected food and had adventured several times with his party, yet he felt like this time was going to be a survival.

Fortunately he possessed seasonings despite having no ingredients at all.

<br>

「I have no choice but to hunt huh?... I wonder what animals are edible in this world.」

<br>

While saying that while getting a bow from his inventory and wearing a quiver on his back.

He was aiming for the small animals, but there was a big problem at this point.

<br>

「Now that I think about it, I have never gone hunting alone. Yamada-san from the neighborhood did though...」

<br>

Because Satoru was living in the countryside, he deligently interacted with his neighbors.

He had memories of hunting wild boars that damaged the fields, but he only could do it because the huntsman was on his side giving him directions.

This is going to be his first time hunting by himself, if he could not do it he would starve to death.

Without sweating too much he erased his presence and searched for the prey.

<br>

「Found....」

<br>

### Forest Rabbit

Level: 5

**HP**: 50 / 50

**MP**: 10 / 10

---

<br>

It was an ordinary rabbit.

Rabbits are very vigilant and they would flee by the faintest sound.

Besides, they had an habit of eating their own feces, he would throw all of its organs out and just have the meat.

<br>

He decided to draw an arrow and aim from the top of a tree.

The arrow flew from the bow the moment the forest rabbit turned its back to him.

<br>

―――**DOGOOOOOOOOOOOON!!** `explosion sfx`

<br>

「This is... just too powerful. Did I choose the wrong bow maybe?」

<br>

The poor rabbit-san, cruelly turned to pieces of meat.

The weapon used was just too strong.

Satoru was staring fixedly at the bow.

<br>

---

## Magically Restructured Bow Nº 321

Attack power: +30000

<br>

<div class="tag-container">
    <code>Physical Enhancement</code>
    <code>Doubled Power</code>
    <code>Offensive Power Increase</code>
    <code>Accuracy Rate Increase</code>
    <code>One Hit Kill</code>
    <code>Target Explosion</code>
</div>

---

<br>

「I've killed it needlessly...」

<br>

It wasn't a weapon made for hunting.

He had built it with his friends for fun, but he didn't thought that it was that impractical.

There's no meaning in worrying about dismantling if it just blows up the prey.

With this is impossible to secure food.

<br>

「Wait, calm down... I'm sure that 【Hold Back】 is among the manufacture spells. If I use it, perhaps...」

<br>

One shot, one kill, and then it blows the prey into tiny pieces.

In that case, he just needed to hold back as if he were dieing and then finish it with a knife.

He started searching for the next prey while thinking that.

<br>

「This time for sure....」

<br>

Once again he drawed the bow, this time he properly held back like his life was at stake.

Quickly he switched to the knife and then finished the forest rabit.

The rabbit didn't blow up this time, finally he could catch his breath.

<br>

The problem now is where he is going to dismantle it.

<br>

「If possible I'd like to do it by the waterside」

<br>

After this he cought more 3 rabbits, and then loitered around in search for a waterside.

He was hungry but it wasn't time for it.

Other beasts could come if he stood near this blood stinking place.

<br>

　―――*GYA, GIGYA, GIGYAGYA*!

<br>

And just like that...

<br>

「Geh, GOBLIN?!」 `Geh is a surprised sfx, probably`

<br>

The standard of a fantasy world.

When you see one, think that there are a hundred more. The [king](https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/aGjpEAz_460s.jpg) of the small fry.

The successor of the **G**, and a promised monster.

> **TN**: **G** stands for `gokiburi` wich means cockroach.

When the goblin saw Satoru, it blew the whistle just like an scout from an historical play would.

The forest bacame noisy and goblins were gushing forth from inside the forest and quickly increased their number.

<br>

「You are kidding me!!」

<br>

He retreated vigorously.

He did hunt a rabbit, however, he didn't feel like facing an humanoid monster.

It wasn't like he couldn't win, but because like any person living in modern society, he hadn't a pleasant feeling about murder.

Even before that, Satoru lacked the resolve to live in such an harsh environment.

It'll be a little while until he becomes self-aware of that.

<br>

Satoru was fleeing while an army of goblins pursued him.

While being faster, Satoru was hopelessly outnumbered.

Fleeing through a path one goblin blocked him, fleeing by other path there were another army of goblins.

The number that gradually grew now surpassed one hundred.

<br>

「WHAT'S UP WITH THIS FOREEEEEEEEEEEEEST!!?」

<br>

Satoru didn't knew.

This extensive forest was known in this world as a savage land called 【Farfran's Giant Greenary】.

Several monster were inhabiting the place, lots of them were still unidentified, a beasts' kingdom.

There were plenty of monster groups that surpassed a thousand individuals, goblins were only one of them.

> TN: `ファーフランの大深緑地帯` was translated as `Farfran's Giant Greenary`, but it can be translated in a lot of ways. If you are insterest enough you can search [here](https://jisho.org) the caracters for further understanding.

<br>

*Just when I thought about fleeing by flying, innumerable arrows surrounded me and I couldn't do it.*

*This is exactly what numerical advantage is about*

<br>

Faint but sure, something like a light could be seen ahead of the frantically running Satoru.

Just like the moths are attracted by light, Satoru faced towards the light.

<br>

What appeared in front of his eyes was a village.

Well, judging by scale it could be called a city.

<br>

「Sa-Safe... **UGEH**!?」 `**TN**: disgusted surprised sfx, I'M SURE OF IT`

<br>

He though that for a brief moment before realising he had been mistaken.

That is because what stood before his eyes was not a village, it was a goblin army.

Indeed, the place where he headed to was the goblins' settlement.

<br>

He couldn't help but laugh for diving straight to enemy territory.

<br>

「aha... AHAHAHAHAHA・・・・・・」

<br>

His mind started showing some dangerous signs.

<br>

　―――GIGYA! GYOGYAGYAGYA!!

<br>

Goblins wanting to bring down the prey and then eat it were closing in.

The goblins were yet to notice.

Satoru who was in front of them wasn't an existence that they should've poked.

<br>

「Every one of you... BEGOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNEEEE!!!!!」

<br>

Suddenly there were a devasting tempest of magical power.

This power makes the goblins tremble.

But it was already too late, Satoru was about to release a forbidden sorcery.

<br>

「【Dark Judgement】」

<br>

A massive jet black sphere made from that monstruous magical power appears. And then several smaller spheres of the same color were produced, each of them started swallowing the goblins without mercy.

Thunders scattered around and a wicked whirlwind was blowing. The massive sphere swallowed the goblins and the very ground, erasing everything.

It was an one-sided massacre and destruction.

<br>

After battling against evil gods a few times, he had analised their attacks from an scientific point of view and came up with this nefarious spell.

This oppressive playing easily made the gobling settlement vanish, and if it was not enough, the aftermatch even bore a giant crater on the surface of this gigantic forest.

This wasn't the end though, a powerful explosion was released with the sorcerer as its origin.

<br>

The ultra-gravity spell 【Dark Judgement】 was, in short words, the creation of several black holes on the verge of its critical point and randomly firing it.

The goblins were compressed to quantum units and then used as fuel for a wide range implosion.

It's firepower increases as the number of enemies does, and it will definetly not end until the enemy disappears.

This spell was just like a nightmare.

<br>


　聡が正気を取り戻し見た光景は、まるで隕石が落ちたかのような巨大なクレーターであった。

　辺りは月面の言ってもおかしくない様な大小のクレーターが生まれている。



「・・・・・・・僕は、取り返しのつかない過ちを犯してしまった・・・・」



　全くである。

　生き残るためとは言え、その強力な魔法の爪痕は想像を絶する。

　これで消費魔力が百で留まっていること自体おかしい。

　やっている事はただの自然破壊である。



　後に残されたのはゴブリンであった者達の大量の魔石だけであた。

　例え肉体を破壊されようと、後に残される魔石はダイヤよりも硬い魔力の結晶体なのだ。

　その為、強力な殲滅魔法でも魔石だけが残される。

　無論、中には砕け散る物も存在するが、それでも有り余るほどの魔石を手に入れる事に成功した。



「・・・・水辺を探そう」



　だが、彼の心境は穏やかでは無かった。

　何故なら、自分が如何に規格外で非常識なのかを実感してしまったからである。

　その足取りは重く、まるで幽鬼の様であった。







　三時間後、聡は川に出る事に成功した。

　どうやら湧き水のようで透明度が高く、川で泳ぐ魚すら見て取れる。

　果てしない空腹感を堪え、早速フォレスト・ラビットの解体を始めようとした。



　ゲーム内では解体用のナイフが存在し、当然の如くそれも構築されている。



「解体か……どうしようか？」



　流石に一人でやった事が無いので躊躇いがあるが、どうしても空腹感には勝てそうにはない。

　その上、周囲は野生の世界であり、いつ魔物が襲って来るかが分からない程だ。

　心を決めていざ解体しようとした時、聡の目の前には驚くべき光景が広がっていた。



「……僕は・・・・・いつ解体したんでしょう？」



　そう、フォレスト・ラビットが綺麗な肉に取り分けられていたのである。

　しかも毛皮には血の一滴すらついていない。

　明らかに異常な事態である。



「仕方が無い。もう一羽を解体・・・・・へ？」



　フォレスト・ラビットを持ち上げた瞬間、聡の腕は無意識に反応したが如く、美味しそうな肉に解体してしまった。

　それも恐ろしく正確な速度をもってだ。

　見ていた本人も驚愕する程である。



「これはもしかして・・・・・・職業スキルが関係あるのか？」



　彼のスキルには【狩神】【解体補正】が存在している。

　このスキルには狩猟に対しての補正が大幅に引き上げられるのだ。

　職業スキルには＜士＞若しくは＜見習い＞、＜師＞、＜鬼＞、＜帝＞、＜神＞の五段階に分けられ、その補正も大幅に変わる。

　まぁ、職業によっては異なる呼び方もあるが、概ねこれが基本である。

　そこに個人スキルが加われば、処理する速度は桁外れであろう



　職業スキルを手に入れる為に…例えば剣士になるには、スキルの【剣術】を極めなくてはならない。

　聡の職業スキルは全て＜神＞であり、達人の域をぶっちぎりで超えていたのである。

　正に神業の速度で解体するその精度は、他の追随を許さぬ程に洗練されていた。





「これはもう、人の領域じゃありませんね……。どこかで隠遁生活の方が良いのではないでしょうか？」



　相当の場数を踏まねば上がらないスキルが、異常なまでに高い。

　つまりは、それだけゲームにのめり込んでいたと言う事実なのだが、それが現実になると話が変わって来る。

　こうなると、どこかの国に目を付けられ面倒な事態になり兼ねない。

　流石にそれは遠慮したかった。



「それに、できる事なら結婚もしたいですが…、こんな化け物じゃあ無理でしょうかねぇ～……」



　未だＤＴである彼には深刻な問題であった。

　若返るための秘薬も作れるほど素材は余っているが、今の状況では作る事は叶わない。

　更に言えば、この世界の金が無いのが問題であった。



「まぁ、この世界の通貨基準が、日本円と似ているのは救いですが……」



　通貨の表示は、１ゴルが一円。

　其処から五ゴル・十ゴル・五十ゴル・百ゴル・五百ゴルと上がって行く。

　全てが金貨だが、その大きさによって価値が違うのだ。

　一千万ゴルともなると、もはや金の延べ棒であり、錬金術師が必死に金を錬成しているのがこの世界の常識である。

　地球とは異なり、金は比較的安価で手に入りやすい環境だった。　



　ウサギ肉を焼きながら一人考える姿は、正直寂しい。

　それでも、何とか寂しさを紛らわす聡であった。



「そう言えば……この世界は命の値段も安そうですね。盗賊が出てきたら殺せるのでしょうか……ハァ～」



　ゲーム内の設定を考えれば、この世界も複数の国家が乱立している事になる。

　その中でどこの国に所属するかによって自分の扱われ方も異なって来るのである。

　ある国では魔導士が冷遇され、ある国では亜人種達が差別対象となり、ある国では軍事強化の為に強制的に軍属にさせられる。

　あくまで設定の話ではあるが、決してあり得ないと言切れる話じゃ無かった。

　ましてや犯罪者相手に躊躇うようではこの先も生きては行けず、時に断固とした決断が要求される事もある。

　少しでも低いリスクで生きる為には、目立たない方が良いのである。



「まぁ、今考えても仕方が無いか……食事を済ませてしまいましょう」



　そう言いながら焼き上がった兎肉を口に運ぶ。



「美味い……」



　広大な深緑地帯の片隅で、おっさんが一人寂しく肉を喰らう。

　無言で狩った兎肉を貪る様は、まるで原始時代に戻ったような哀れな姿であった。

　だが彼は食事を続ける。

　それだけ空腹だったのであった。　



　その後、木の上にロープで自分を括り付け、就寝する事にする。

　地上で寝るよりは安全であると判断したのだが、翌朝尻が痛かった為にこの方法は止める事にした。



「正直、寝心地は最悪でしたね。あぁ……尻が痛い…」



　何か別の事と勘違いされそうな言い方である。



「今日も狩りをしながらスキルの把握をしていきましょう。剣の方はどうなのでしょうか？」



　今持っている武器の類は、威力の面では申し分ない。

　むしろ過剰戦力の様に思える。



　腰に差した二振りの剣は、見た目は地味だが持てる技術の粋を結集して作り上げ、趣味と悪ふざけの赴くままに作り上げた凶悪な武器である。

　全ての装備が地味な為に目立つ事は無いが、同時に他者からは侮られそうである。

　何しろ、彼の見た目は前髪で目が見えないくらいに無雑作に伸ばしたボサボサ髪に無精髭。

　背はやや丸めがちで、いかにも冴えないオッサンである。



　だが、そんな冴えないオッサンはゲーム内では異常な強さで無双していた。

　そんな非常識な力を実際に持つ人間がいたとしたら、周囲の人達に恐れられ避けられるのは明白だろう。

　羨望と嫉妬の目で見られるのも遠慮したい所だが、孤独のまま生きて行くのも避けたい。

　寂しい人生は何としてでも防がなければ為らない。



　ならば極力実力を出さずに相手を圧倒するしかないのだ。

　それも無難な立ち位置で手加減してだ。

　その基準が彼には分からなかった。



「結局は、今の体に慣れるしかないか……めんどくさ…」



　１０年近く田舎でスローライフを送っていた為、彼は率先して何かをしようとする気にはなれ無いでいる。

　もう『俺、ＴＵＥＥＥＥＥＥＥＥＥＥＥＥＥ！！』などと言っていられる歳では無いのだ。

　人並み程度の家庭は持ちたいという細やかな夢しかない。

　その為にも、彼は自分の力を掌握するしかなかった。



「どこかに良い相手はいないものでしょうか……」



　そんな事を言っていると、彼の警戒領域に何かの生物反応が感じ取れた。

　こうしたアクティブに反応するスキルは実に重宝する。



　―――ガサ……



　草木がすれる音に耳を傾け、同時に腰の剣に手を携える。

　姿を現したのは豚の頭部を持つ肥満体の魔物。

　お馴染みのオーク種である。



「【ミート・オーク】……これは食べれますね。倒しますか……」



　俗に言う食べられる魔物。

　ミートなだけに、肉として美味しく頂ける魔物なのだ。

　同時にファンタジー界のエロモンスターとしても有名で、それはこの世界でも変わりはない。

　繁殖力が強く、雌のオークがいくらいても足りない程に性欲が強い。

　ゲーム内でも大量繁殖をして、大規模戦闘に発展するイベントが頻繁にあった。

　好戦的で雑食性なために、常に討伐され続けている魔物なのである。



　聡は瞬時に間合いを詰めると、一瞬にして両手の剣でオークを斬り殺した。

　瞬殺である。



「…コレは何と言いますか、手加減してこうなのですか？　僕はどれだけ化け物なんでしょうねぇ～？」



　オークは聡に気付いていた。

　しかし、それでも反撃が間に合わなかったという事は、聡の攻撃速度が速い事を意味する。

　まるでどこかの流浪人だ。



　そして、手早くオークを解体すると、次の標的を求めて移動を開始する。

　そんな行為がしばらく続いた。



　結論。『強過ぎて洒落に為らない』という事だけが判明する。



「食料は確保できましたが……流石に肉ばかりでは…」



　流石に三食肉ばかりでは飽きて来る。

　山菜など探してみたが、何故か薬草の類しか見つからない。

【ブラッディ・ベラドンナ】など、猛毒以外に使い道が無いのだ。

　この毒性が薬効成分に変わるのだが、機材が無い以上は宝の持ち腐れである。

　魔導錬成という手段も残されてはいるが、製作した魔法薬を収める器が無いので、魔法薬を製作する意味も無い。

　今のところ、無駄な物が増えて行くばかりであった。



「パンが……白いご飯が恋しい」



　サバイバル生活二日目にして、聡は早くも音を上げていた。

　元々農家であったために多少の不便さは我慢できるが、こんな陸の孤島の様な場所での流浪のサバイバルはキツイ。

　歩けば出て来るのは原住民では無く、自分を餌と思って襲い掛かって来る凶悪生物ばかりなのだ。

　それも、かなり高い頻度で接触してしまう。



　素材は増える、食事事情は変わらない。

　そんな殺伐とした状況に嫌気がさしていた。

　そもそも現代社会で生きていた人間に、こうした原始的生活をさせるのには無理があるだろう。

　いっそ死んだら楽になれるのではと、本気で考える始末だ。



「なぜ、山菜などの野草が見つからない…。肉ばかりでは栄養が偏るじゃないかですか……」



　愚痴ばかりが口から出る。



「神なんて信じない……。奴等は敵です」



　―――ＧＹＵＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯＯ！！



　神を侮辱した罪か罰か、ソレは空から飛来した。

　緑色の鱗に覆われた、長い首を持つ空の魔物。

　二本の足に鋭い爪を持ち、口の中には鋭利な牙が生えそろっている。



「わ、ワイヴァ―ン！？」



　ワイヴァ―ンは聡を執拗に追い駆け、彼を腹に収めようと、幾度も一撃離脱を繰り返す。

　流石に空からの魔物が相手では、慣れない躰では対処するには無理があり、何度も攻撃を避けながら逃げ続けるしか無かった。　



　命懸けの鬼ごっこは、日が暮れるまで続けられるのだった。
